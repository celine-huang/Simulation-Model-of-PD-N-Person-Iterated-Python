# Simulation-Model-of-PD-N-Person-Iterated-Python

## Introduction

The Prisoner's Dilemma is a classic example of a non-zero-sum game in game theory. In its iterated form, the same players repeatedly face the dilemma, allowing them to reward or punish each other based on past decisions. 

## Model Basis

This project is a full Python reimplementation of [Simulation-Model-of-PD-N-Person-Iterated-NetLogo](https://github.com/celine-huang/Simulation-Model-of-PD-N-Person-Iterated-NetLogo), which itself was adapted from the NetLogo Prisoner's Dilemma N-Person Iterated model. [^1] This Python version is recommended for greater flexibility, efficiency, and comprehensive analysis.

## Study Overview

In this study, we build upon the original model to explore the strategic implications of repeated Prisoner's Dilemma games. Modifications include the implementation of more complex strategies, adjustments to payoff rules, and extended analysis of population-level outcomes. This approach allows us to investigate how different cost sizes affect agent interactions and population dynamics.
